To solve the "Longest Word" challenge, you can follow these steps:

1. Remove punctuation from the input string to ignore it. You can use regular expressions or iterate through each character, removing punctuation marks.
2. Split the string into words by using a space as the delimiter. This will give you an array of words.
3. Initialize a variable called "longest_word" with an empty string. This variable will store the current longest word.
4. Iterate through each word in the array and compare its length with the length of the "longest_word." If the current word is longer, update the value of "longest_word" to the current word.
5. Finally, return the value of "longest_word" as the result.

Here's a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
import re

def LongestWord(sen):
    sen = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', sen)  # Remove punctuation
    words = sen.split()  # Split the string into words
    longest_word = ''
  
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > len(longest_word):
            longest_word = word

    return longest_word
```

For the input string "Hello world123 567", the function `LongestWord("Hello world123 567")` would return "world123" since it is the longest word without considering punctuation.
